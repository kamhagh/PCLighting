Lighting for my PC (top, bottom inside or all!)

Arduino Recieves a number (0xFFFFFFF);
the first 3x2 bits are color
the last bit bit is LED Number with 10bits free for Commands or other stuff
will be moved to bare AVR code as I'm not using Arduino firmware (i might not, there's no point doing this in AVR as i already know how and it's not a commerical product!) and i will use a digiSpark arduino board as it is like a usb flash and is exactly what i need! (with some unused ports :S, maybe i will use normal leds for the other parts)

TODO:
1. Make a human suitable saving format!
2. forget about C++ app, it sounds like a nightmare, no serial libraries found! X_X making my own is going to be a huge project!
3. Improve performance!
